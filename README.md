####  Project 2 Executive Summary: 
Executive Summary: This report attempts to forecast US nonfarm payroll data obtained from FRED. To accomplish this, several analysis will be performed starting with using tslm to fit linear trend and seasonal component to data and checking its residuals. Then, the data will be fit with harmonic regression to experiment with changing fouriere terms aimed at minimising the AICc or CV value. then, the 2 models will be compared for forecast accuracy.

#### Project 3 Executive Summary: 
Executive Summary: First part of analysis uses Domino's Quarterly Sales data from 2002 Q1 - 2019 Q3, of which 80% of data were used for training and 20% of data used for testing the forecast accuracy. This report compares the forecast accuracy of different methods (TSLM, ETS, ARIMA, STL, RW with Drift) and determines the best forecasting method. Second part of analysis uses Hasbro's Quartlery Sales data where different methods (TSLM, ETS, ARIMA, STL, RW with Drift) were compared using the  accuracy metrircs, mainly MSE, to determine the model with best fit for each forecst period. 


#### Project 4 Executive Summary:
Executive Summary: This report investigates the dynamic interaction between Domino's Pizza quarterly revenue, US consumer sentiment (CS) and US retail sales (retail and food services). Vectore Autoregression (VAR) was preformed on the dataset. In addition, the VAR model was compared against ARIMA, ETS, TBATS, NNETAR model to determine which model has the best forecast accuracy using the accuracy metrics, mainly with MSE. 

#### Final Project: Hasbro Quarterly Sales data
Executive summary: using the knowledge obtained above, this report will use various forecasting methods and copmare their accuracy to determine the best model to use to forecast Hasbro's Quarterly Sales data.
